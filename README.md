The team representatives are:

# Roles and responsibilities

Each team representative has a specific set of tasks. They are described below:

- **Project Lead**
The project lead is responsible for tasks like:

	- Being the Point of Contact with Hamoye.
	- Delegating tasks to team members and monitoring the project from its inception to production.
	- Taking complete responsibility for the whole project. If anything goes wrong, the first person who is answerable is the team lead as he sets the tasks for the team members and sets deadlines for the team members to follow. Hence, they are answerable for any mishap that happens.

- **Assistant Project Lead**
	 
	- Has the responsibility to monitor tasks at a much deeper level. The lead would most probably be looking at the whole project and getting an overview, the assistant project lead should be there to support. During the absence of the lead, the assistant lead should be able to handle any problems that the team is facing and provide help.

- **Query Analyst**

	- Has the responsibility of documenting everything that is happening in the project. Our team needs to most probably publish our project via a blog, and the query analyst makes sure that the complete workflow of the project is documented in the most detailed manner upto the most miniscule details.
